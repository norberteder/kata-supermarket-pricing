# kata-supermarket-pricing

The kata *Supermarket Pricing* is originally a design kata, but I use it to learn Python. Therefore, it is 
implemented here. The main goal is to calculate easy as well as complex prices. Let us have a look at different 
pricing:

* Apples: 3.74 €/kg
* Iced tea: 1,69 €/bottle, 0.84 € if you buy more than 6 bottles
* Beer: 1.04 €/bottle with a four-for-three offer
* Sweet pepper: 1.29 € each, 3 for 3 €

## TODO

* Write tests with given pricing
* Solve requirement
* Extend with further examples
