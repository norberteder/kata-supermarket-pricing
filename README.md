# kata-supermarket-pricing

The kata *Supermarket Pricing* is originally a design kata, but I use it to learn Python. Therefore, it is 
implemented here. The main goal is to calculate easy as well as complex prices. Let us have a look at different 
pricing:

* Apples: 3.74 €/kg
* Iced tea: 1,69 €/bottle, 0.84 € if you buy more than 6 bottles
* Beer: 1.04 €/bottle with a four-for-three offer
* Sweet pepper: 1.29 € each, 3 for 3 €

## TODO

* Write tests with given pricing
* Solve requirement
* Extend with further examples

## History

* Start implementation of simple unit tests to cover some of the given requirements. Creating class stubs so unit tests can run (and fail as there is no concrete implementation). The idea is to calculate the price for the shopping card, based on the given value and item units, as it will be done in the supermarket. I am not completely sure how to handle bags and so on.
* Change naming etc. to meet official [naming conventions](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions).
